Hi! Let's put copies of the footprints here. 

The files in this folder should be the ones used as footprints, since KiCAD asks that the user select a folder filled with footprint files to be used.

Main changes should be done to these files and not the footprint files located within the "symbols" folder with the symbols.


.kicad_mod files are the 2D footprints used in the PCB layout editor.
.step files are the 3D footprints used to generate 3D renderings of the board and to be exported to softwares like SolidWorks
