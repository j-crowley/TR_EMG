# TR_EMG
The Trans-radial EMG (TREMG) is a PCB designed to increase SNR for surface-level EMG electrodes which is then digitized and sent to a controller to drive a robotic prosthetic. This is for individuals with upper limb amputations at the trans-radial level. It enables users to regain dexterity and perform a wide range of tasks using a prosthetic hand.
